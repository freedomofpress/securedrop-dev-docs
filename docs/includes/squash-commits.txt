.. note::
          It is generally good practice to maintain a clean git history by
          reducing the number of commits to a reasonable minimum. You can do
          this by squashing closely related commits through an interactive
          rebase once your PR is close to being merged.

          If you would like a project maintainer to help you with squashing
          commits in a PR, please don't hesitate to leave a comment requesting
          assistance.
