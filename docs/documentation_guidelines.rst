Documentation Guidelines
========================

SecureDrop's documentation for end users (sources, journalists and administrators)
is available at https://docs.securedrop.org. It is written in `reStructuredText`_
(reST) and hosted by `Freedom of the Press Foundation`_ using a theme by
`Read the Docs`_. The documentation files are stored in the ``docs/`` directory of the
`SecureDrop docs repository <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs>`_.

Developer documentation is maintained separately via the `SecureDrop developer
documentation repository <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-dev-docs>`_
and published to https://developers.securedrop.org.

Documentation versions
----------------------

SecureDrop maintains two versions of its end user documentation:
`stable <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/>`_ (appropriate for end users)
and `latest <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/>`_ (appropriate for developers).
``stable`` is the default, and is built from our latest signed git tag.
``latest`` is built from the head of the ``main`` git branch
of the `securedrop-docs repository <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs>`_.

The developer documentation at https://developers.securedrop.org/
is published only in a single version. When changes are merged into
the ``main`` branch of the `securedrop-dev-docs repository <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-dev-docs>`_,
a new version of the documentation is built immediately.


Updating Documentation
----------------------

To get started editing the docs:

.. _clone_the_rep:

#. Clone the SecureDrop documentation repository.

   For the end user documentation:

   .. code:: sh

      git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs.git

   For the developer documentation:

   .. code:: sh

      git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-dev-docs.git


#. Install the dependencies:

   .. include:: includes/virtualenv.txt

   .. code:: sh

      pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/requirements.txt


   .. _build_the_docs:

#. Build the docs for viewing in your web browser:

   .. code:: sh

      make docs

   You can then preview the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Navigate to
   the ``docs/`` directory to make changes to the documentation
   rendered on https://docs.securedrop.org or https://developers.securedrop.org/.
   The documentation pages will automatically rebuild in the browser
   window, as you make changes; you don't need to refresh the page manually.

   After performing lint checks, open a PR against the ``main`` branch
   of the appropriate repository.


Testing Documentation Changes
-----------------------------

You can check for formatting violations by running the linting option:

   .. code:: sh

      make docs-lint

The ``make docs`` command will display warnings if mistakes are found, but will
still build the documentation. Using ``make docs-lint`` will convert any warnings
to errors, causing the build to fail.

To test the documentation for broken links, run the following command from
a reliable internet connection:

   .. code:: sh

      make docs-linkcheck


Project maintainers will need to approve the PR before it can be merged.

.. include:: includes/squash-commits.txt

Pushing to a contributor fork
-----------------------------
As a maintainer, you can push directly to a contributor fork, as long as there
is an active Pull Request corresponding to the branch you are pushing to, and
you have added the contributor remote with authentication enabled (i.e. the ``url``
value in ``.git/config`` starts with ``git@github.com``).

.. _updating_screenshots:

Updating Screenshots
--------------------

The user guides for SecureDrop contain screenshots of the web applications.
To update these screenshots automatically you can run this command from within
your main SecureDrop repository checkout:

.. code:: sh

   DOCS_REPO_DIR=/path/to/docs make update-user-guides

This will generate screenshots for each page in the web application and copy
them to the folder ``docs/images/manual/screenshots`` in your documentation
repository checkout, where they will replace the existing screenshots. Stage for
commit any screenshots you wish to update. If you wish to update all screenshots,
simply stage for commit all changed files in that directory.

Prior to generating screenshots as part of a release update:

1. Ensure that the version string shown in the screenshots is the version that
   will be released. You can manually edit ``securedrop/version.py`` in your
   SecureDrop repository checkout if it currently contains a release candidate
   string.
2. Configure the `New York World sample instance <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/blob/main/User%20Testing/NYWorld%20Demo%20Site/logo.png>`__
   logo. Because the functional tests used to generate the logo may themselves
   update the logo, it is safest to temporarily overwrite the stock logo in
   ``securedrop/static/i/logo.png`` in your SecureDrop repository checkout.

.. note::

   The automated screenshots update does not update screenshots for Tails,
   the Tor Browser UI, the firewall captive portal, etc. If you notice
   discrepancies in those screenshots, please open issues so they can be
   addressed at a later point.

.. _updating_upgrade_guides:

Updating Upgrade Guides
-----------------------
We ship an upgrade guide for each release. As part of updating the documentation
for a release:

1. Create a new upgrade guide copied from the most recent one and add it to the
   index.
2. Ensure that the ``latest_upgrade_guide`` reference at the top of the document
   is only present in the latest upgrade guide.
3. If this is a `major-level or minor-level <https://semver.org/>`__ release,
   remove the oldest upgrade guide and associated patch-level guides from the
   documentation.

   **Example:** If you are adding a guide to upgrade from 4.5.0 to 4.6.0, and the
   oldest guide present is from 4.2.0 to 4.3.0, remove it along with any guides
   for 4.2.1, 4.2.2, etc.).
4. If this is a major-level or minor-level release, make sure to include the
   reminders in ``docs/includes/backup-and-update-reminders.txt`` towards the
   end of the document.
5. If you are not also the release manager, check with them about any other
   pertinent release-specific instructions that should be included.
6. Finally, ensure that mentions of the current version are up to date. You can use
   the ``update_version.sh`` convenience script to do so.

   **Example:** If you are adding a guide to upgrade to 2.4.2, you can run
   ``./update_version.sh 2.4.2``, then verify that the version changes are pertinent
   and save them.

Style Guide
-----------

Please see the `reStructuredText`_ Primer by the Sphinx project as a reference
for writing in the markup language used for this documentation.

.. _reStructuredText: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html


Code Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure that example commands in codeblocks are easy to copy and paste.
Do not prepend the ``$`` shell prompt indicator to example commands:

  .. code::

     echo hello

In the context of a terminal session with both typed commands and printed
output text, use ``$`` before the typed commands:

  .. code::

     $ echo hello
     hello
     $ echo sunshine
     sunshine


Date Format
^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow AP guidelines for formatting dates. Don't use the ISO format for adding
dates to the documentation.

To avoid confusion, format dates in the documentation as Month_Name Day, Year:

  .. code::

     October 13, 2020

  not

  .. code::

     13 October, 2020
     13/10/2020
     10/13/2020
     10/13/20
     2020-10-13
     2020-Oct-13



File Paths
^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Cloning<clone_the_rep>` the SecureDrop git repository creates a directory
called ``securedrop``. This ``securedrop`` directory also contains a
``securedrop`` subdirectory for app code.

.. code::

     .
     ├── securedrop
     │   │
     │  ...
     │   ├── securedrop
    ... ...

To avoid confusion, paths to files anywhere inside the SecureDrop git repository
should be written as ``./some_dir/file``, where ``.`` is the top level directory
of the SecureDrop repo.

Use absolute paths when referring to files outside the SecureDrop repository:
``/usr/local/bin/tor-browser``.


Glossary
^^^^^^^^

Text taken directly from a user interface is in **bold face**.

    "Once you’re sure you have the right drive, click **Format Drive**."

SecureDrop-specific `glossary <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/glossary.html>`_ is in *italics*.

    "To get started, you’ll need two Tails drives: one for the *Admin
    Workstation* and one for the *Secure Viewing Station*."

When referring to virtual machines in the development environment, use
lowercase for the name:

    app-staging VM


Line Wrapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lines in the plain-text documentation files should wrap at 80 characters. (Some
exceptions: complex code blocks showing example commands, or long URLs.)


Usage and Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To avoid confusion, lists should include the "Oxford comma":

    "You will need an email address, a public GPG key for that address, and the
    fingerprint for that key."

Capitalize all section headings in title case:
