Release Management
==================

The **Release Manager** is responsible for shepherding the release process to
successful completion. This document describes their responsibilities. Some items
must be done by people that have special privileges to do specific tasks
(e.g. privileges to access the production apt server),
but even if the **Release Manager** does not have those privileges, they should
coordinate with the person that does to make sure the task is completed.

In addition to the Release Manager, we typically recognize the following
roles for a SecureDrop release:

- **Deputy RM:** for additional time zone coverage, to delegate specific tasks,
  and to act as backup in case of the RM becomes unavailable for any reason.

- **Localization Manager:** to manage outreach to the translator community, and
  to coordinate translation updates of existing strings.

- **Deputy LM:** like the RM, this role is backed up by another team member.

- **Communications Manager:** to prepare and distribute pre-release and
  release messaging (including standard upgrade instructions, release notes,
  social media posts, and support portal announcements)

During the full release cycle, we also recognize the following role:

- **Community Manager:** to engage with community contributors, offer initial
  responses to new issues and Pull Requests, and follow up with other SecureDrop
  team members as appropriate.

We aim to rotate membership in these roles regularly.

Pre-Release
-----------

1. Open a **Release SecureDrop <major>.<minor>.<patch>** issue to track release-related activity.
   Keep this issue updated as you proceed through the release process for transparency.
   If applicable, consult the `specific considerations  <tails_only_releases>` for releases
   that only modify code running on Tails-based workstations.

#. If this is a regular release, work with the localization manager for this
   release cycle to :ref:`review and merge translations <i18n_release_management>`.

#. Copy a link of the latest release or release candidate from the `Tails apt repo
   <https://deb.tails.boum.org/dists/>`_ and include it in the issue. The
   goal is to make sure we test against the lastest Tails release, including release candidates,
   so that we can report bugs early to Tails.

#. Create a release branch.

   For a regular release, create a release branch off of ``develop``::

     git checkout develop
     git checkout -b release/<major>.<minor>.0


   For a point release, create a release branch off of the latest merged release branch::

     git checkout release/<major>.<minor>.0
     git checkout -b release/<major>.<minor>.1

#. For each release candidate, update the version files, code repo changelog, and Debian package
   changelog.

   #. If there have been new translations since the release branch or the last
      release candidate was cut, ask the localization manager to review them for
      merge into ``develop`` and then backport them into the release branch.

   #. First collect a list of changes since the last release. For example, if the last release was
      version 1.6.0, you can view changes in GitHub by running::

         https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/compare/release/1.6.0...develop

      Also check `SecureDrop milestones <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/milestones>`_
      to make sure all milestone changes are included. Append GitHub PR numbers to each
      change. You will add these changes to the changelog in the next step.

   #. Run ``update_version.sh`` which will walk you though updating the version files and
      changelogs. When you run the script, pass it the new version in the format
      ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>~rcN``::

        ./update_version.sh <major>.<minor>.<patch>~rcN

      .. note:: A tilde is used in the version number passed to ``update_version.sh`` to match
                the format specified in the `Debian docs
                <https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/first.en.html#namever>`_ on how to
                name and version a package, whereas a dash is used in the tag version number
                since `git does not support the use of tilde
                <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format#_description>`_.

      .. note:: In the Debian changelog, we typically just refer the reader to the ``changelog.md``
                file.

   #. Disregard the script-generated ``.tag`` file since this is only used when we need to sign the
      final release tag (see `Release Process`_ section).

   #. Sign the commit that was added by ``update_version.sh``::

        git commit --amend --gpg-sign

   #. Push the branch::

        git push origin release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>

   #. Push the unsigned tag (only the final release tag needs to be signed, see
      `Release Process`_ section)::

        git push origin <major>.<minor>.<patch>-rcN

   #. Once the tag is pushed, notify the Localization Manager so that the localization team can get
      started on translations.

#. Build Debian packages:

   a. Check out the tag for the release candidate.
   b. Build the packages with ``make build-debs``
   c. Save and publish :doc:`build metadata <build_metadata>`.
   d. Open a PR on `securedrop-apt-test
      <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-apt-test>`_ that targets the ``main``
      branch with the new debs. Do not include tarballs or any debs that would overwrite
      existing debs. Changes merged to this branch will be published to ``apt-test.freedom.press``
      within 15 minutes.

     .. warning:: Only commit deb packages with an incremented version number: do not clobber
                  existing packages. That is, if there is already a deb called e.g.
                  ``ossec-agent-3.6.0-amd64.deb`` in ``main``, do not commit a new version of this
                  deb.

#. Write a test plan that focuses on the new functionality introduced in the release. Post for
   feedback and make changes based on suggestions from the community. Once it's ready, publish the
   test plan in the `wiki <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/wiki>`_ and link to it in
   the **Release SecureDrop <major>.<minor>.<patch>** issue.

#. Create a new QA matrix spreadsheet by copying the google spreadsheet from the last release and
   adding a new row for testing new functionality specific to the release candidate. Link to this
   in the **Release SecureDrop <major>.<minor>.<patch>** issue.

#. At this point, QA can begin. During the QA period:

   * Encourage QA participants to QA the release on production VMs and
     hardware. They should post their QA reports in the release issue
     such that it is clear what was and what was not tested. It is the
     responsibility of the release manager to ensure that sufficient QA
     is done on the release candidate prior to final release.

   * Triage bugs as they are reported. If a bug must be fixed before the
     release, it's the release manager's responsibility to either fix it
     or find someone who can.

   * You may, at your discretion, escalate a `"release blocker"
     <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/labels/release%20blocker>`_
     to "coordinated response" status.  In this case, you (or the person you
     designate, such as the issue's reporter) should coordinate an
     incident-responseâ€“style investigation and resolution of the bug, using
     tools like Etherpad and Google Docs/Sheets to consolidate information in
     real time and convening short sync-up meetings as often as needed.  After
     a coordinated response, make sure that the findings gathered in these
     venues are reported back out publicly (i.e., in the original GitHub issues)
     for transparency and for future reference.

   * Backport release QA fixes merged into ``develop`` into the release
     branch using ``utils/backport.py``, which uses ``git cherry-pick -x
     <commit>`` to clearly indicate where the commit originated from.

   * At your discretion -- for example when a significant fix is merged
     -- prepare additional release candidates and have fresh Debian
     packages prepared for testing.

   * For a regular release, the string freeze will be declared by the
     translation administrator one week prior to the release. After this
     is done, ensure that no changes involving string changes are
     backported into the release branch.

   * Work with the Communications Manager assigned for the release to prepare a pre-release
     announcement that will be shared on the support.freedom.press support portal, securedrop.org
     website, and Twitter. Wait until the day of the release before including an announcement for a
     SecureDrop security update. For a point release, you may be able to skip the pre-release
     announcement depending on how small the point release is.

     Make sure a draft of the release notes are prepared and shared for review, and that a draft PR
     is prepared into the ``securedrop-docs`` repository which:

     - bumps the SecureDrop version of the documentation using the ``update_version.sh``
       script in that repository;
     - adds :ref:`upgrade instructions and other release-specific technical documentation <updating_upgrade_guides>`;
     - :ref:`updates the screenshots <updating_screenshots>`.

Release Process
---------------

#. Prepare the final release commit and tag. Do not push the tag file.
#. Step through the signing ceremony for the tag file. If you do not
   have permissions to do so, coordinate with someone that does.
#. Once the tag is signed, append the detached signature to the unsigned tag::

    cat 1.x.y.tag.sig >> 1.x.y.tag

#. Delete the original unsigned tag::

    git tag -d 1.x.y

#. Make the signed tag::

    git mktag < 1.x.y.tag > .git/refs/tags/1.x.y

#. Verify the signed tag::

    git tag -v 1.x.y

#. Push the signed tag::

    git push origin 1.x.y

#. Ensure there are no local changes (whether tracked, untracked or git ignored)
   prior to building the debs. If you did not freshly clone the repository, you
   can use git clean:

   Dry run (it will list the files/folders that will be deleted)::

      git clean -ndfx

   Actually delete the files::

      git clean -dfx

#. Build Debian packages:

   a. Verify and check out the signed tag for the release.
   #. Build the packages with ``make build-debs``.
   #. Save and publish :doc:`build metadata <build_metadata>`.
#. In a clone of the private
   `securedrop-apt-prod <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-apt-prod>`_
   repository, create a branch from ``main`` called ``release``.
#. In your local branch, commit the built packages to the ``core/focal``
   directory.
#. Run the ``tools/publish`` script. This will create the ``Release`` file.
#. Commit the changes made by the ``tools/publish`` script.
#. Push your commits to the remote ``release`` branch. This will trigger an
   automatic upload of the packages to ``apt-qa.freedom.press``, but the
   packages will not yet be installable.
#. Create a `draft PR <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests>`__
   from ``release`` into ``main``. Make sure to include a link to the build
   logs in the PR description.
#. A reviewer must verify the build logs, obtain and sign the generated ``Release``
   file, and append the detached signature to the PR. The PR should remain in
   draft mode. The packages on ``apt-qa.freedom.press`` are now installable.
#. Coordinate with one or more team members to `confirm a successful clean install in production VMs
   <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/wiki/QA-Procedures#user-content-preflight-testing>`__
   using the packages on ``apt-qa.freedom.press``.
#. If no issues are discovered in final QA, promote the packaging PR out of draft
   mode.
#. A reviewer must merge the packaging PR. This will publish the packages on
   ``apt.freedom.press``.
#. The reviewer must delete the ``release`` branch so that it can be re-created
   during the next release.
#. Update the `public documentation <https://docs.securedrop.org/>`_:

  * Review and merge the ``securedrop-docs`` PR that bumps the version and adds
    the upgrade documentation for this release.

  * Verify that there are no changes on the ``main`` branch of ``securedrop-docs``
    that should not be released into the stable version of the documentation.

    If necessary, you can create a branch from an earlier commit. Follow the
    ``release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` convention for the branch name in
    ``securedrop-docs``, and cherry-pick at least the changes from the PR above
    onto it via a backport PR.

  * Create a tag signed with your developer key in the format
    ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` on the ``HEAD`` of the ``main`` branch or of the
    docs release branch you created in the previous step. ::

      git tag -as <major>.<minor>.<patch>
      git push origin <major>.<minor>.<patch>

    This will update the stable version of the documentation.

  * Subsequent changes to the stable version should be tagged with PEP-440
    conformant `post-release separators <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#post-release-separators>`__
    in the format ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>-1``,  ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>-2``,
    and so on.

#. Verify that the public documentation has been updated. Inspecting or
   restarting builds requires Codefresh access; if you lack access, a tech lead
   or infra team member can do so on your behalf.
#. Create a `release
   <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/releases>`_ on GitHub
   with a brief summary of the changes in this release.
#. Make sure that release notes are written and posted on the SecureDrop blog.
#. Make sure that the release is announced from the SecureDrop Twitter account.
#. Make sure that members of `the support portal
   <https://support.freedom.press>`_ are notified about the release.
#. Make sure that version string monitored by FPF's Icinga monitoring system
   is updated by the infrastructure team.

Post-Release
------------

1. Backport the changelog from the release branch into ``develop``.

   a. Collect the hashes of all the commits that modified ``changelog.md`` during the release::

         git log --pretty=oneline changelog.md

   #. From a new branch based on ``develop``, cherry-pick each commit in the ``git log`` output
      from the previous step. Make sure to use the ``-x`` flag so that the original commit is
      appended to the new commit.

#. Bump the SecureDrop version so that it's ready for the next release.

   a. Create a new minor release candidate. Only add a commit message and accept the default changes
      for everything else (it's fine to leave the changelog entries with empty bullets). For
      example, if the release is 1.3.0, then you'll run::

         ./update_version.sh 1.4.0~rc1

   #. Disregard the script-generated ``.tag`` file since this is only used when we are making an
      actual release.

   #. Sign the commit that was added by ``update_version.sh``::

         git commit --amend --gpg-sign

   #. Make a PR to merge these changes into ``develop``.

#. Monitor the `FPF support portal <https://support.freedom.press>`_ and the
   `SecureDrop community support forum <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/support>`_ for any new user
   issues related to the release.

.. _tails_only_releases:

Releases that only modify code on Tails workstations
----------------------------------------------------
On occasion, a point release may only modify code that is deployed to Tails-based
*Admin Workstations* and *Journalist Workstations*. Even in those cases, it is
generally preferred to issue a release that also updates the server packages
(bumping the version number):

- This ensures that users attentive to version numbers are not confused by the
  discrepancy between the version shown on their workstations compared with the
  version number shown in other parts of the SecureDrop user interface.
- It also mitigates the risk of any unexpected side effects. Notably, our uptime
  monitoring of known SecureDrop instances checks for differences between the
  version number returned by a server's metadata endpoint, and the latest
  GitHub release object.

If, because of time sensitivity and team availability, a release manager decides
to proceed with a workstation-only release, they should observe the following:

- As with regular releases, create tags for any release candidates and test
  the expected behavior on *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations* as appropriate.
- Coordinate with the infrastructure team to ensure that uptime monitoring will
  not alert on the discrepancy between server-side version numbers and the latest
  release object on GitHub.
- After the release passes QA, push a signed tag. This will enable the graphical
  updater on Tails workstations to detect the new release.
- Follow the standard release communications process, including publication of
  a release object on GitHub. Make note of the fact that this is a workstation-only
  release (see the `SecureDrop 2.6.1 release communications <https://securedrop.org/news/securedrop-261-released/>`_
  as an example).
