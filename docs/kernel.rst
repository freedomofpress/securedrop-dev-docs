Linux kernel maintenance
========================

We build and publish our own Linux kernels with additional
`grsecurity hardening patches`_.
The `kernel-builder`_ repository contains scripts that fetch upstream
kernel tarballs plus grsecurity patches and produces Debian packages.

Testing a new kernel
--------------------

The following steps should be performed for all of the `recommended hardware`_:

#. Install the new kernel packages on your *Monitor Server* using unattended-upgrades,
   e.g. ``sudo apt update && sudo unattended-upgrades --debug`` or wait for the automatic
   nightly upgrade.
#. Reboot. Verify with ``uname -r`` that you are using the new kernel.
#. If it doesn't boot, see the `Troubleshooting Kernel Updates`_ documentation.
#. Install the ``paxtest`` package, run with ``sudo paxtest blackhat``, and verify it doesn't
   return any new errors nor warnings.
#. Install `spectre-meltdown-checker`_ and the ``binutils`` package, run with
   ``sudo ./meltdown-checker``, and verify it doesn't return any errors nor warnings.
#. Upgrade your *Application Server* to the new kernel and reboot.
#. Run basic smoke tests of SecureDrop by verifying you can send a submission and a journalist can reply.
